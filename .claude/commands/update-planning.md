description: Update planning docs to reflect implementation progress.

Help me reconcile current implementation progress with the planning documentation.

1. **Gather Context** — If not already provided, ask for: feature/branch name and brief status, tasks completed since last update, new tasks discovered, current blockers or risks, and planning doc path (default `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`).
2. **Review & Reconcile** — Summarize existing milestones, task breakdowns, and dependencies from the planning doc. For each planned task: mark status (done / in progress / blocked / not started), note scope changes, record blockers, identify skipped or added tasks.
3. **Produce Updated Task List** — Generate an updated checklist grouped by: Done, In Progress, Blocked, Newly Discovered Work — with short notes per task.
4. **Next Steps & Summary** — Suggest the next 2-3 actionable tasks and highlight risky areas. Prepare a summary paragraph for the planning doc covering: current state, major risks/blockers, upcoming focus, and any scope/timeline changes.
